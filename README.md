In my project I used followin assumptions:
- User have to type an existing user. If username does not exist there is no notification about it (possible feature to add).
- User have to have an internet connection in order to retriev data from Github. 
However after downloading repository data connection is needed no more and user can access languages offline.
In my project I used a following simplifications:
- After downloading a repository with name the jtextfield with username is not changing its text to blank.
- After downloading a repository user have to click a repository to check details which means no default language details are uploaded. 
- Private repositories are not visable, so if all repositories of certain user consist of only private repositories no data will be displayed nor a notification.
Aplication instructions:
- To run an application download Github_repository.jar file and run it on your machine
